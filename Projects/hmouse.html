			<h2 id="maintitle">Handheld Mouse Project</h2>
			<p>The Handheld Mouse Project is a project that I'd been meaning to explore for some time.
			The idea that I could literally control my computer using some homemade monstrosity was facinating,
			and the "plug and play" aspect of USB mice and keyboards seemed extraordinarily brilliant.
			</p>
			<p>My design goals for this project were to develop something that could replace all of the functions
			of a USB mouse, without the need for a tabletop. I also wanted to keep accessibility in mind, so my
			design couldn't rely on any movement other than the hand and fingers. Finally, the design had to be
			both accurate and efficient: It could not take too long to get across the screen, or misclick any
			more than a standard mouse.
			</p>
			<image src="../assets/hmouse_5.jpg" id="hmouse_5">
			<p>I decided to build this project on the back of a Pro Micro ATmega32U4 development board. The 32U4
			board boasted support for Arduino's Mouse.h library, which could communicate as an HID device without
			external wiring. In addition, the profile of the board was comparatively small, and could fit into a
			handheld case (or onto a wooden prototype) with ease. Finally, the board was reasonably cheap, at ~$7
			apiece.
			</p>
			<p>Other components of this project included a joystick module (which consists of nothing more that
			two potentiometers and a pushbutton), several pushbuttons, resistors, and some prototyping jumper
			wires and breadboards.
			</p>
			<p>The Arduino code is not difficult to understand. It is made up of 4 functions which perform the 
			following overall tasks: 
			</p>
			<p>Take input from the Handheld Mouse
			<p class="code">void loop() {
			<br>
			<br>//take all values to check for input
			<br>int rawxmouse = analogRead(x); 
			<br>int rawymouse = analogRead(y);
			<br>int leftclick = digitalRead(left);
			<br>int rightclick = digitalRead(right);
			</p>
			
			<br>Normalize and map position values to the curve of a power function
			<p class="code">
			int joymap(int rawmouse, char axis){
			<br>/*converts the 0-1023 data from a joystick to up to (-127)-127 data processable by Mouse.move functionality. */
			<br>/*uses accel value to determine relative mouse velocity  */
			<br>int normalize = map(rawmouse, 0, 1023, -512, 512); /* change this based on data*/
			<br>int correct;
			<br>if (axis == 'x'){
			<br>	correct = normalize + 13;
			<br>}
			<br>else if (axis == 'y'){
			<br>	correct = normalize + 4;
			<br>}
			<br>
			<br>int cubic = correct*.01 * correct*.01 * correct*.01* correct*.01 * correct*.01;
			<br>int analogmouse = map(cubic, -3700, 3700,-25,25);
			<br>return analogmouse;
			<br>}
			</p>
			
			<br>Determine if button presses are singular or holds
			<p class="code"> if(digchange(leftclick,oldleftclick) == 1){
			<br>if(leftclick == HIGH){
			<br>Mouse.press();
			<br>Serial.println("LeftClick");
			<br>}
			<br>if(leftclick == LOW){
			<br>Mouse.release();
			<br>Serial.println("UnLeftClick");
			<br>}
			<br>}
			<br>
			<br>int digchange(int state, int oldstate){
			<br>//digital change function. Returns 0 if no change, 1 if change. call before pressing/unpressing button.
			<br>
			<br>if(state == oldstate){
			<br>return 0;
			<br>}
			<br>else return 1;
			<br>}
			</p>
			
			<br>Send data as HID to computer
			<p class="code">#include &ltMouse.h> 
			<br>Mouse.move(xmouse,ymouse,0);
			</p>
			
			</p>
			
			<p>The final product works exactly as intended. The joystick controls the mouse pointer, speeding up 
			or slowing down based on the extent that the joystick is pushed. The upper push-button controls the 
			mouse click, the lower one, the right-click. The mouse has been programmed to send a pressing signal if
			it detects a continuous push, to mimic the functionality of a standard mouse.
			</p>

			<p>Aside from removing accessibility and space constraints, the Handheld Mouse is also advantagous in 
			that it can function as a computer joystick. Upon testing, the project works very well in spaceflight 
			simulators that any standard mouse would fail in.
			</p>
			<p>This project taught me a lot: As well as being one of my first finished projects with an
			Arduino-based board, I also learned the basics of soldering, and taught myself new skills in programming.
			</p>
			<p>The final C++ code has been published under Files as an .ino file.
